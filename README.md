# **Irish Quiz**

**Irish Quiz** is a simple command-line quiz game to test the players knowledge of Ireland. The quiz has ten multi choice questions relating to Ireland. 

## Project Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to create a quiz that allows users to test their knowledge and learn new facts about Ireland. 

## How to Play:

 - When the player opens up the quiz they are met with "IRISH QUIZ" in     ASCII art with a welcome message "Welcome to the Irish Quiz". This is followed by another message "Press Enter to start the quiz". 

 - The player will need to hit Enter to go any further. Once the player hits Enter two messages will pop up "Hello and welcome to the Irish Quiz" and "Good luck!". This is then followed with the first question. 

 - The player will then choose the correct answer for the question. Once the player chooses their answer the game will provide them with the correct answer, whether they got it right or wrong and then their score. If they get the answer right the score will increase by one. If not it will stay the same. 

 - After each anser to the question the next question will appear until it gets to question 10 where it will give the same results as above but instead of the next question popping up a message will appear to ask "Do you want to play again? (yes/no):"

 - if the player types "yes" the game will restart. If they type "no" the game will end.
